# PixInsight MCP — Project Instructions

## What This Project Is
Automated deep sky astrophotography processing pipeline for PixInsight. A Node.js script
drives PixInsight's PJSR scripting engine via file-based IPC to process astronomical images
through a configurable, branching pipeline (HaRGB, HaLRGB, LRGB workflows).

## Environment
- Node.js: `/Users/aescaffre/.local/node-v22.13.1-darwin-arm64/bin` (add to PATH)
- PixInsight: `/Applications/PixInsight/`
- Bridge: `~/.pixinsight-mcp/bridge/` (file-based IPC)
- PJSR: ECMAScript 5 only (no let/const/arrow functions)

## Key Commands
```bash
# Build
export PATH="/Users/aescaffre/.local/node-v22.13.1-darwin-arm64/bin:$PATH"
cd /Users/aescaffre/pixinsight-mcp && npm run build

# Run pipeline
node scripts/run-pipeline.mjs --config /path/to/config.json

# Resume from checkpoint
node scripts/run-pipeline.mjs --config /path/to/config.json --restart-from stretch

# Start editor
node editor/server.mjs
```

## Project Structure
```
scripts/run-pipeline.mjs  — Main pipeline script (~1600 lines)
editor/default-config.json — Default pipeline configuration
editor/index.html          — Web UI for pipeline editor
editor/server.mjs          — Editor backend (Express.js)
src/                       — MCP server TypeScript source
```

## Skills
The `.claude/skills/pixinsight-pipeline/` directory contains comprehensive processing knowledge:
- **SKILL.md** — Pipeline overview, quick start, parameter tuning guide
- **reference/pjsr-processes.md** — LHE, HDRMT, MorphologicalTransformation, LRGBCombination
- **reference/pjsr-gotchas.md** — ECMAScript 5 constraints, file I/O, crop masks, memory
- **reference/xterminator-tools.md** — SXT, NXT, BXT parameters and best practices
- **reference/ghs-stretch.md** — GHS formula implementation via PixelMath
- **reference/processing-knowledge.md** — Equipment settings, lessons learned, quality assessment

When processing a new target, read the SKILL.md first, then reference files as needed.

## Continuous Skill Improvement
Skills and memory must be kept up to date as the project evolves. After every session:
- **New technique discovered?** Add it to the relevant reference file or SKILL.md
- **Parameter tuned or validated?** Update the parameter tuning guide and processing-knowledge.md
- **Bug or gotcha found?** Document it in pjsr-gotchas.md or the "Common Issues" section
- **Pipeline code changed?** Keep SKILL.md processing order and config format in sync
- **New process or tool used?** Add PJSR parameter reference to pjsr-processes.md

Do this proactively — don't wait to be asked. The goal is that skills always reflect the latest validated knowledge, so any new session starts with the best available information.

## Critical Rules
- PixelMath has NO `pow()` — use `exp(exponent*ln(base))`
- SXT on linear: `stars=true` only (NO unscreen). On non-linear: `stars=true, unscreen=true`
- XISF files open with crop_mask windows — close them immediately
- No spaces in StarAlignment output paths
- Close images aggressively to manage PixInsight memory
- Do NOT use star erosion/threshold — creates artifacts. Non-linear extraction is clean.
- GHS: the pipeline uses the native GeneralizedHyperbolicStretch process module when
  installed (it is on the Windows box) and falls back to the PixelMath port otherwise
  (macOS box lacks the module). `ghsCode()` emits a runtime branch handling both.
- NO SetiAstro-derived code (star stretch, Statistical Stretch) — removed 2026-07-09 at
  Dan's request; do not reintroduce. Star extraction is the non-linear SXT-unscreen method.
